# Search Enhancement Tool


The Search Enhancement Tool is a Python-based utility that aims to provide the most relevant results for a search query. It utilizes various techniques and tools to enhance the search experience.

## Features

- **Spellcheck and Autocorrect**: The tool employs the Pyenchant library to perform spellchecking and autocorrection on the entered search query. This ensures that even if a user makes a typo, they still receive accurate and relevant results.

- **Personal Word List (PWL)**: The tool utilizes file handling to manage a Personal Word List. Users can add words to this list, which will then be used for autocorrection. This helps to tailor the search experience to specific terminology or jargon.

- **Regular Expression Validation**: The entered search query is validated using regular expressions to ensure that it follows a valid format. This prevents potential issues and improves the accuracy of search results.

- **Database Functionality**: The tool implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for a database. This enables efficient storage and retrieval of search history, enhancing user convenience and facilitating result refinement.
